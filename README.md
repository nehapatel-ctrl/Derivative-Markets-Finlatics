# Derivative  Markets Experience Program - Finlatics

This repository contains three detailed financial case studies focused on portfolio structuring, derivatives trading, and market sentiment analysis. The objective was to apply quantitative techniques to real-world financial scenarios and enhance decision-making in investment management.

## Case Project 1: Portfolio Structuring and Return Optimization
The first case study aimed to calculate expected returns for diversified investment portfolios containing **debt**, **equity**, and **Futures & Options (F&O)** instruments. Weighted returns were computed for each component, and required F&O returns were derived to achieve target **Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGRs)** of **15%** and **18%**. This case provided insights into how to optimize a portfolio’s return based on strategic allocation and performance expectations.

## Case Project 2: Call Option Strategy Analysis
The second case explored the use of **call options** under various market conditions. By building a **scenario tree** that reflected both **bullish and bearish probabilities**, the project assessed whether an option should be exercised or allowed to expire. The **payoff formula** used was:
This exercise highlighted the importance of scenario-based modeling for understanding **option payoffs under uncertainty** and improving trading strategy formulation.

## Case Project 3: Market Sentiment and Put-Call Ratio (PCR) Analysis
The third project involved analyzing **market sentiment** using the **Put-Call Ratio (PCR)**. PCR was calculated for both halves of a trading day. Notably high values—**9.84** and **11.12**—suggested strong **bearish sentiment** and potential **oversold conditions** in the market. This study emphasized the significance of sentiment indicators in short-term market timing and risk management.
